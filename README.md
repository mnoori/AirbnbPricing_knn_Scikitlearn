One challenge that hosts looking to rent their living space face is determining the optimal nightly rent price. In many areas, renters are presented with a good selection of listings and can filter on criteria like price, number of bedrooms, room type and more. Since AirBnB is a marketplace, the amount a host can charge on a nightly basis is closely linked to the dynamics of the marketplace.
As a host, if we try to charge above market price for a living space we'd like to rent, then renters will select more affordable alternatives which are similar to ours.. If we set our nightly rent price too low, we'll miss out on potential revenue.

One strategy we could use is to:

* find a few listings that are similar to ours,
* average the listed price for the ones most similar to ours,
* set our listing price to this calculated average price.

While AirBnB doesn't release any data on the listings in their marketplace, a separate group named [Inside AirBnB](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) has extracted data on a sample of the listings for many of the major cities on the website. In this post, we'll be working with their dataset from October 3, 2015 on the listings from Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. [Here's a direct link to that dataset.](http://data.insideairbnb.com/united-states/dc/washington-dc/2015-10-03/data/listings.csv.gz) Each row in the dataset is a specific listing that's available for renting on AirBnB in the Washington, D.C. area.
